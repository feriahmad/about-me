Implement Reusable Workflow Github Action,"August 20, 2025 9:15 AM",,"Implemented reusable CI/CD workflows using GitHub Actions to standardize build, test, and deployment pipelines across multiple projects. This reduced duplication, improved maintainability, and streamlined the development lifecycle.",https://github.com/jabardigitalservice/workflow-super-app,"ArgoCD, Docker, Github, Github-Action"
Pipeline CI/CD with GitOps,"August 20, 2025 8:36 AM",,"Designed and implemented a CI/CD pipeline using GitOps principles with GitLab and ArgoCD. The pipeline integrates Harbor as a container registry, Trivy for vulnerability scanning, and Kubernetes for automated deployments, ensuring secure, consistent, and scalable application delivery. The release flow consists of two phases: for staging, code successfully built and tested in GitHub Actions is automatically synced to ArgoCD and deployed to the staging environment; for production, a Merge Request is created and reviewed by DevOps or a Lead before being promoted to the live environment.",,"ArgoCD, Github, Gitlab, Harbor, Kubernetes, Trivy"
Provisioning VM Instance GCP with Terraform & Atlantis,"August 20, 2025 10:19 AM",,"Implemented Infrastructure as Code (IaC) by provisioning VM instances in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Terraform, integrated with Atlantis for automated plan and apply workflows. This setup enabled consistent, auditable, and collaborative infrastructure management through GitOps practices.",https://github.com/feriahmad/terraform-gcp-vm-instance,"Atlantis, GCP, IaaS, Terraform, VM"
Kubernetes Cluster Deployment with Ansible and Kubeadm,"August 20, 2025 10:02 AM",,"Deployed a Kubernetes cluster using Ansible and Kubeadm to automate the provisioning and configuration process. This project demonstrated Infrastructure as Code practices, enabling consistent cluster setup, reduced manual intervention, and improved reliability for multi-node environments.",https://github.com/feriahmad/k8s-kubeadm-ansible,"Ansible, Docker, Kubeadm, Kubernetes"
"Proisioning MongoDB with Ansible (Install, Backup, Restore & Hardening)","August 20, 2025 10:26 AM",,"Automated MongoDB provisioning and management using Ansible, covering installation, backup, restore, and security hardening. This project demonstrated Infrastructure as Code practices to ensure consistent deployments, reliable data recovery, and improved database security.",https://github.com/feriahmad/mongodb-ansible,"Ansible, MongoDB, Ubuntu"
Management User Access Control Kubernetes with Rancher & Keycloak,"August 20, 2025 8:36 AM",,"Implemented centralized user access control for Kubernetes clusters by integrating Rancher with Keycloak as an Identity Provider. This project enabled Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Single Sign-On (SSO), and secure authentication management across multiple clusters. The focus was on providing developers with direct access to product-specific clusters, making it easier to perform debugging and execute commands when needed.",https://medium.com/jds-engineering/management-user-access-control-kubernetes-with-rancher-keycloak-b4e2ba5c35a0,"Keycloak, Kubernetes, RKE, Rancher"
Observability with LGTM Stack,"August 20, 2025 8:36 AM",,"Developed a monitoring and alerting system using Prometheus and Grafana to improve application observability. The setup enabled real-time metrics collection, visualization, and proactive alerting, reducing incident response time and improving system reliability.",,"Grafana, Prometheus, Uptime"
Reduce Cost Up to 80% GCP with CDN,"August 20, 2025 11:09 AM",,"Reduced cloud infrastructure costs by up to 80% through the integration of Cloudflare CDN with GCP. This approach not only optimized expenses but also enhanced application speed, availability, and security. The project utilized Firebase for hosting, Amazon S3 for storage, and Cloudflare for CDN and caching.",,"AWS, CDN, Cloudflare, Cloudfront, GCP, S3"
Automation Scheduler Maintenance Page Sapawarga Mobile Apps,"August 20, 2025 11:13 AM",,"Developed an automation workflow with n8n to schedule and trigger maintenance mode in Sapawarga Mobile Apps by updating Firebase values. This eliminated manual late-night interventions by QA/PM, reduced overtime, and streamlined the process of activating maintenance pages during incidents or planned events.",https://n8n.digitalservice.id/workflow/T4Cx2ZRiEzHR9omv,"Automation, Firebase, n8n"
Install ArgoCD with Terraform,"August 20, 2025 2:07 PM",,"This project demonstrates the integration of Terraform with ArgoCD to automate Kubernetes deployments through GitOps practices. It highlights my ability to build scalable, reliable, and consistent infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code principles.",https://github.com/feriahmad/argocd-terraform,"ArgoCD, Kubernetes, Terraform"
